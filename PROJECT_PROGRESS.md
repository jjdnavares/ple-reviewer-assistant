## Current Status
As of May 24, 2025:
- Core application framework is in place
- Basic UI components have been implemented
- Main exam functionality is working
- AI integration has been started
- Backend API structure is established
- Design system created for consistent styling
- Reusable layout components implemented
- Fixed frontend styling issues on landing page and About page
- Implemented Typography components for consistent text styling

## Root Causes of Frontend Styling Issues

The following issues were identified and fixed:

1. **Inconsistent Component Usage**
   - Problem: Some pages were using HTML elements directly while others used UI components
   - Solution: Implemented and used Typography components consistently across pages

2. **Client-Side Rendering Issues**
   - Problem: Missing "use client" directives where client-side interactivity was needed
   - Solution: Added appropriate directives to pages requiring client-side functionality

3. **Hydration Errors**
   - Problem: Browser extensions adding attributes causing React hydration mismatches
   - Solution: Added suppressHydrationWarning to body element in root layout

4. **Style Inconsistencies**
   - Problem: Inconsistent use of color schemes and spacing throughout the application
   - Solution: Applied consistent Tailwind CSS classes based on the design system

## Next Steps
1. Continue applying consistent styling across remaining pages (practice exam, content, statistics)
2. ~~Complete user profile and authentication features~~ âœ… COMPLETED
3. Enhance AI integration for personalized study recommendations
4. Implement PDF processing for importing exam questions
5. Develop testing suite for all components
6. Begin deployment preparation

With the user profile and authentication features now fully implemented, the next focus areas are improving the AI integration and implementing the PDF processing functionality.
